# Keylogger Documentation

This is a simple keylogger that logs all the keys pressed by the user.
This logger is not for malicious purposes.
It is to be used for educational purposes only.
an to understand how keyloggers work.

## How to use

- 1. Clone the repository
- 2. Install the required packages
- 3. Run the main.py file
- 4. The keylogger will start logging

Once all the packages are installed, you can run the keylogger. To see the results, you must first press the esc key to stop the keylogger. Then, you can open the logs folder and see the results. in keylog.txt file you will see all the keys pressed by the user.

## Note

My thought process was simple I wanted to demonstrate how a keylogger captures keyboard inputs and logs them to a file. that could later be sent to a remote server if configure for that. In this case this logger does not have that configuration. As it is only designed to sniff pressed keys and log them to a file.
